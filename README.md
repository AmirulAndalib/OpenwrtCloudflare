## Updating

### Automatic Updates  
If you enabled automatic updates during installation, a daily cron will keep `cloudflared` up to date.

### Manual Update  
For those who skipped auto-updates, you can update on demand by running:
```bash
/usr/sbin/cloudflared-update
```
This script will:  
1. Check the latest release tag on GitHub  
2. Compare it to your current version  
3. Download and install the new binary if an update is available  
4. Restart the `cloudflared` service automatically  

Run it any time to pull in the latest Cloudflare Tunnel release.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues such as insufficient disk space or missing tools, the installation script attempts to address these automatically. For more complex issues, you may need to intervene manually.
